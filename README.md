# Job Description

Seeking an experienced and motivated Firmware Developer with a focus on 32bit ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers and hardware interfacing.

Primary responsibilities will include firmware development of ATSAM4E microcontroller with interfaces with BT & LTE SoC daughterboards as well as a communication link with another similar board through CAN. Product also needs to perform sensing and bidirectional data transfers between several different in/out interfaces, such as I2C, USB, GPIO, UART and SDIO. The microcontroller needs to properly coordinate between different sub-units through these interfaces to satisfy the goals of the project.

Mandatory Skills & Requirements:

- Strong experience with 32bit ARM/PIC microcontrollers
- Hardware interfacing experience with different communication technologies: USB, I2C, SPI, GPIO, UART, CAN, and SDIO
- Experience with Bluetooth and LTE modules, and interfacing them with microcontroller
- Experience with LCD character displays and their programming
- Basic knowledge of dealing with hardware and the necessary physical interfacing/connections
- Fluent in C, C++ and scripting languages
- Strong embedded firmware & RTOS experience
- Team player who is proactive, self-motivated and with good communication skills
- Creative, organized and able to work independently with minimal supervision

## First milestone

1. GPIO config and read
2. CAN Bus Communication Basic
3. SDCard Comunication (SDIO)
4. LCD driver
